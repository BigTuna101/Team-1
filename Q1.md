Ø  Students can take a University ID/ Branch ID only if it is available in the University/ Branch database.

Ø  Student Name, University Name and Branch Name should all be in Capital Letters. (If the user has not entered accordingly, then the program must convert it into Capital Letters and store.)

Ø  Display the entire  student list/ University list/  Branch List

Ø  Delete all students whose CGPA<6.0 and store them in another list. They will come back to original student list if their CGPA>=6.0(Update function)
